# Project_2

1) I started out by wireframing my project, seeing how I wanted to proceed.

2) Setting up all my directories

3) Creating all my ejs file.

4) Start creating the routes using the '7 restful routes as reference'

5) Created a public folder for normal css

6) Created a partial folding linking all css and other links such as boostrap, normalize, skeleton

7) Created a nav ejs partial for my header bar

8) Made a schema for both my recipes, sessions, users

9) Tried following the markdown to create a comment section, could not get it to work from the markdown.

10) Commented out directories and files associated with the markdown.

11) Attempted the comments section again but this time with a simpler way, I would like a less on the markdown for the correct way.

12) Worked on the styling with bootstrap mainly

If I had more time I would like to be able to add:
- Search functionality
- Checkbox next to ingredients so people may add the list of ingredients to a shopping list
- Expand more on the recipes and categories
